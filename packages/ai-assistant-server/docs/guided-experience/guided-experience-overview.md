# Guided Experience Overview

## Introduction

Tamy Finance aims to be more than just a financial tracking toolâ€”it's designed to be a true financial guide that helps users improve their financial well-being through conversational AI. This document outlines our approach to creating a guided experience within our multi-agent chatbot system that supports users with limited financial knowledge.

## What is a Guided Experience in a Conversational Context?

A guided experience in the context of Tamy Finance's multi-agent chatbot refers to a proactive, supportive approach that:

1. **Anticipates user needs** and provides assistance before users encounter problems
2. **Reduces cognitive load** by breaking complex financial tasks into manageable conversational steps
3. **Educates users contextually** about financial concepts when they're most relevant
4. **Builds confidence** through positive reinforcement and celebration of progress
5. **Adapts to user knowledge levels** by personalizing guidance based on observed behavior
6. **Maintains natural conversation** while providing structured guidance

## Why Guided Experiences Matter for Financial Chatbots

Financial management is inherently complex and often emotionally charged. Our users face several challenges:

- **Financial anxiety**: Many users feel stressed or anxious about their finances
- **Knowledge gaps**: Users may lack understanding of basic financial concepts
- **Decision paralysis**: Too many options can lead to indecision or avoidance
- **Low confidence**: Users may doubt their ability to make good financial decisions
- **Inconsistent habits**: Financial management requires consistent engagement
- **Chatbot uncertainty**: Users may be unsure how to effectively interact with a financial AI assistant

A guided experience addresses these challenges by:

- Reducing anxiety through clear, step-by-step conversational guidance
- Filling knowledge gaps with contextual education
- Simplifying decisions with smart recommendations
- Building confidence through positive feedback and small wins
- Encouraging habit formation through gentle nudges and reminders
- Providing structured conversation paths that help users achieve their goals

## Core Principles of Guided Experiences

### 1. Conversational Progressive Disclosure

Introduce complexity gradually through conversation:

- Start with essential concepts and simple questions
- Deepen the conversation as users demonstrate understanding
- Provide "just enough" information in each message
- Offer paths to learn more when users express interest

### 2. Contextual Education

Deliver financial education at the moment it's most relevant:

- Explain concepts when they arise naturally in conversation
- Connect abstract concepts to the user's specific situation
- Use plain language and relatable examples
- Provide deeper educational resources for interested users

### 3. Personalized Guidance

Tailor the conversation based on user data:

- Adapt guidance based on stated goals and challenges
- Modify recommendations based on observed behavior
- Respect different learning styles and preferences
- Recognize and respond to user progress

### 4. Positive Reinforcement

Build confidence through celebration and encouragement:

- Celebrate progress and achievements, no matter how small
- Frame setbacks as learning opportunities
- Provide encouraging feedback for positive behaviors
- Use conversational elements to make achievements meaningful

### 5. Frictionless Assistance

Make help readily available without disrupting the conversation:

- Provide proactive guidance at potential points of confusion
- Make help accessible but not intrusive
- Maintain context awareness throughout the conversation
- Balance structured guidance with natural conversation

## Current Implementation in Our Multi-Agent System

Our LangGraph-based multi-agent system currently implements guided experiences through:

### 1. Specialized Guidance Agents

Different agents provide domain-specific guidance:

- **Financial Agent**: Guides users through budgeting, account management, etc.

- **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates guidance across different domains

### 2. Guidance Service

Our `GuidanceService` provides:

- Initialization of guidance sessions for specific tasks
- Step-by-step advancement through guidance flows
- Data extraction from user responses
- Dynamic prompt generation for guidance steps
- Language-aware guidance in the user's preferred language

### 3. Guidance Types

We currently support several guidance types:

- **Budget Creation** - Guides users through creating a budget
