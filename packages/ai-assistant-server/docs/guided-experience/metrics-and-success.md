# Metrics and Success Measurement

## Introduction

Measuring the effectiveness of guided experiences is essential for continuous improvement and ensuring that our guidance approach is delivering value to users. This document outlines the key metrics, measurement methodologies, and success criteria for evaluating guided experiences in Tamy Finance.

## Measurement Framework

Our measurement framework is organized around four key dimensions:

1. **Engagement**: How users interact with guidance features
2. **Comprehension**: How well users understand financial concepts
3. **Behavior**: How guidance influences financial actions
4. **Outcomes**: How guidance impacts financial well-being

Each dimension includes specific metrics, measurement methods, and success criteria.

## 1. Engagement Metrics

Engagement metrics measure how users interact with guidance features.

- 70%+ of existing users exposed to relevant new guidance
- Balanced exposure across different guidance types

**Data Collection**:
```javascript
// Example tracking code
function trackGuidanceImpression(guidanceType, featureContext, isVisible) {
  analytics.track('Guidance Impression', {
    guidanceType, // e.g., 'tooltip', 'tour', 'contextual-help'
    featureContext, // e.g., 'budget-creation', 'transaction-entry'
    isVisible, // boolean indicating if guidance was actually visible
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```
