# User Journey Mapping

## Introduction

This document maps the key user journeys in Tamy Finance and identifies opportunities for providing guidance at each step. By understanding the user's path, emotional state, and potential pain points, we can design targeted guidance that enhances the user experience and builds financial confidence.

3. **User Actions**: What the user does at each stage
4. **Thoughts & Feelings**: The user's emotional state and questions
5. **Pain Points**: Challenges or frustrations the user might experience
6. **Guidance Opportunities**: How Tamy can provide assistance
7. **Success Metrics**: How we measure the effectiveness of guidance

## Emotional States Across Journeys

Understanding the emotional states users experience helps us design more empathetic guidance:

### Common Emotional States

1. **Uncertainty**: "Am I doing this right?"
   - *Guidance approach*: Clear confirmation, examples, and reassurance

2. **Overwhelm**: "This is too much to handle"
   - *Guidance approach*: Break into smaller steps, progressive disclosure, defaults

3. **Anxiety**: "I'm worried about my finances"
   - *Guidance approach*: Positive framing, small wins, privacy reassurance

4. **Confusion**: "I don't understand this concept"
   - *Guidance approach*: Plain language explanations, visual examples, contextual education

5. **Accomplishment**: "I'm making progress!"
   - *Guidance approach*: Celebration, progress visualization, next step suggestions

6. **Frustration**: "This isn't working as expected"
   - *Guidance approach*: Clear error messages, alternative paths, support options

## Transition Points Between Journeys

These are critical moments where users may need additional guidance:

1. **Onboarding → Account Setup**
   - *Guidance needs*: Clear next steps, account setup importance, quick win opportunity

2. **Account Setup → First Transaction**
   - *Guidance needs*: Transaction prompts, simplified first entry, positive reinforcement

3. **Transactions → Budget Creation**

4. **Budget → Goal Setting**

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing guidance for these journeys:

1. **Be contextual**: Provide guidance based on where the user is in their journey
2. **Be concise**: Keep guidance brief and focused on the immediate need
3. **Be optional**: Allow users to skip or dismiss guidance when desired
4. **Be consistent**: Use consistent patterns and language across journeys
5. **Be adaptive**: Adjust guidance based on user behavior and preferences

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize journeys based on user impact and development feasibility
2. Create detailed wireframes for key guidance moments
3. Develop a content strategy for guidance copy
4. Implement tracking for guidance effectiveness
5. Establish a testing plan for guidance features
