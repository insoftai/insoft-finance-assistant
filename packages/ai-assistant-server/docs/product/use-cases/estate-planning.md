### Estate Document Creation

- **Will Preparation Guidance**: Assist with creating or updating a will
- **Power of Attorney Setup**: Help establish financial and healthcare powers of attorney
- **Beneficiary Designation**: Ensure proper beneficiary designations across accounts
- **Document Storage**: Secure storage and organization of estate documents

Example interaction:

User: I don't have a will yet. How should I get started?
Assistant: Creating a will is an important step in estate planning. Here's how to get started:

Essential Elements for Your Will:
1. Executor Appointment: This person will manage your estate after your passing
2. Beneficiary Designations: Who will receive your assets
3. Guardian Nominations: If you have minor children
4. Specific Bequests: Any particular items you want to leave to specific people
5. Residuary Clause: Who receives everything not specifically mentioned

In Brazil, you have several options for creating a will:
1. Public Will (Testamento Público):
   - Created by a notary public
   - Requires two to three witnesses
   - Most legally secure option
   - Cost: Approximately R$1,000-2,500

2. Closed Will (Testamento Cerrado):
   - Written privately, then sealed and registered with a notary
   - Offers more privacy
   - Still requires witnesses
   - Cost: Approximately R$800-1,500

3. Holographic Will (Testamento Particular):
   - Handwritten by you
   - Requires three witnesses
   - Less secure legally, but valid if properly executed
   - Cost: Minimal (notarization fees if desired)

Important Considerations:
- In Brazil, you cannot disinherit necessary heirs (spouse and children) from their "legitimate portion" (typically 50% of your estate)
- You have freedom to distribute the remaining portion ("available quota")
- A will must be updated after major life events (marriage, divorce, birth of children)

Would you like me to help you outline the key elements for your will before you consult with a legal professional?

### Inheritance Tax Planning

- **Tax Liability Estimation**: Calculate potential inheritance and estate taxes
- **Tax Minimization Strategies**: Suggest legal strategies to reduce tax burden
- **International Tax Considerations**: Navigate cross-border inheritance issues
- **Gifting Strategies**: Plan for tax-efficient lifetime gifting

Example interaction:

User: What taxes will my heirs have to pay when they inherit my assets?
Assistant: In Brazil, inheritance taxes are handled at the state level through ITCMD (Imposto sobre Transmissão Causa Mortis e Doação). Here's what your heirs should expect:

ITCMD Tax Overview:
- Tax rates vary by state, typically between 2% and 8% of asset value
- In São Paulo state, the current rate is 4%
- In Rio de Janeiro, rates are progressive up to 8%
- Some states have different rates for direct relatives vs. other beneficiaries

Tax Calculation Example (assuming São Paulo state):
- R$1,000,000 in total assets
- 4% ITCMD rate
- Resulting tax: R$40,000

Key Exemptions and Thresholds:
- Small estates (typically under R$20,000-50,000, depending on the state) may be exempt
- Life insurance proceeds paid to named beneficiaries generally avoid ITCMD
- Retirement accounts with designated beneficiaries may have special treatment

Tax Minimization Strategies:
1. Lifetime Gifting:
   - Annual gifts can reduce your taxable estate
   - Still subject to ITCMD but can be spread out over time
   - Some states offer reduced rates for lifetime gifts vs. inheritance

2. Family Holding Companies:
   - Transferring assets to a family holding company
   - Can facilitate gradual transfer of ownership
   - May provide discounted valuations for tax purposes

3. Trust-like Structures:
   - While traditional trusts aren't recognized in Brazil, similar structures exist
   - "Fundos de Investimento Fechados" can serve similar purposes

Would you like me to analyze your specific asset mix to estimate potential inheritance taxes and suggest optimization strategies?

- **Business Succession**: Plan for the transfer or sale of business interests
- **Wealth Transfer Strategies**: Develop strategies for multi-generational wealth transfer
- **Family Communication**: Facilitate discussions about inheritance plans
- **Legacy Planning**: Help define and implement charitable and family legacy goals

Example interaction:

User: I own a small business. How should I plan for its future after I'm gone?
Assistant: Business succession planning is crucial for ensuring your company thrives after your departure. Here are key considerations for your small business:

Succession Options:
1. Family Transfer:
   - Identifying and preparing family successors
   - Gradual transfer of responsibilities and ownership
   - Equitable treatment of involved vs. non-involved family members

2. Management Buyout:
   - Selling to key employees or management team
   - Structuring affordable payment terms
   - Training and mentoring future leaders

3. Third-Party Sale:
   - Maximizing business value before sale
   - Finding strategic buyers
   - Ensuring smooth transition for employees and clients

4. Hybrid Approaches:
   - Maintaining ownership while transferring management
   - Creating a family holding company with professional management
   - Partial sales to key employees or external investors

Key Documents and Structures:
1. Buy-Sell Agreement:
   - Establishes terms for ownership transfer
   - Sets valuation methods
   - Defines triggering events (death, disability, retirement)

2. Business Valuation:
   - Professional assessment of business worth
   - Updated regularly (every 2-3 years)
   - Helps with fair distribution among heirs
