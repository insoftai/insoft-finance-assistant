# Investment Portfolio Management

## Overview

The Investment Portfolio Management feature adds an Investment Agent to Tamy Finance Assistant, providing users with comprehensive investment advice, portfolio analysis, and market insights. This use case helps users track their investments across multiple accounts, analyze performance, optimize asset allocation, and make informed investment decisions aligned with their financial goals.

## Key Features

### Portfolio Tracking

- **Multi-Account Aggregation**: Consolidate investments across different brokerages and accounts
- **Holdings Visualization**: View complete breakdown of investment holdings
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track returns across different time periods
- **Transaction History**: Record and categorize investment transactions

Example interaction:
```
User: Can you help me track my investments? I have accounts with XP Investimentos and Nubank.
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you track your investments across multiple platforms. To get started, I'll need some information about your accounts.

For each account, could you provide:
1. The current holdings (stocks, funds, etc.)
2. The quantity or value of each holding
3. Purchase dates and prices (if available)

User: In XP, I have R$10,000 in PETR4 shares bought at R$25 each, R$15,000 in an Ibovespa ETF, and R$20,000 in Treasury Direct. In Nubank, I have R$5,000 in their Nu Reserva fund.
Assistant: Thanks for sharing those details. I've created your investment portfolio:

Total Portfolio Value: R$50,000

Account Breakdown:
1. XP Investimentos (R$45,000, 90%)
   - PETR4: 400 shares, R$10,000 (20% of portfolio)
   - Ibovespa ETF: R$15,000 (30% of portfolio)
   - Treasury Direct: R$20,000 (40% of portfolio)

2. Nubank (R$5,000, 10%)
   - Nu Reserva Fund: R$5,000 (10% of portfolio)

Asset Allocation:
- Stocks: 20%
- ETFs: 30%
- Fixed Income: 50%

### Asset Allocation Analysis

- **Current Allocation Assessment**: Analyze current asset allocation against goals
- **Diversification Evaluation**: Identify concentration risks and diversification opportunities
- **Target Allocation Models**: Suggest target allocations based on risk profile and goals
- **Rebalancing Recommendations**: Provide specific rebalancing actions to align with targets

Example interaction:
```
User: I'd like to see if my current allocation makes sense. My goal is long-term growth with moderate risk.
Assistant: I've analyzed your current asset allocation against a moderate risk, long-term growth profile:

Current Allocation:
- Stocks (Individual): 20%
- ETFs (Equity): 30%
- Fixed Income: 50%

Recommended Allocation for Moderate Risk, Long-Term Growth:
- Stocks (Individual): 15%
- ETFs (Equity): 40%
- Fixed Income: 35%
- International Investments: 10%

Key Observations:
1. Your portfolio is slightly overweight in fixed income (50% vs. recommended 35%)
2. You're underweight in diversified equity exposure (30% vs. recommended 40%)
3. You have no international exposure, missing potential diversification benefits
4. Individual stock concentration in a single company (PETR4) creates sector risk

Recommended Adjustments:
1. Reduce Treasury Direct position by R$7,500
2. Increase Ibovespa ETF position by R$5,000
3. Add R$5,000 to an international ETF (e.g., IVVB11 - S&P 500 Brazil)
4. Consider diversifying individual stock holdings beyond PETR4

Would you like me to explain any of these recommendations in more detail or suggest specific investment vehicles for implementation?

### Risk Assessment

- **Portfolio Risk Analysis**: Calculate risk metrics (volatility, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- **Stress Testing**: Simulate portfolio performance under different market scenarios
- **Risk Factor Exposure**: Identify exposure to various risk factors
- **Risk-Return Optimization**: Suggest adjustments to improve risk-adjusted returns

Example interaction:
```
User: I'm concerned about how my portfolio would perform in a market downturn. Can you analyze the risks?
Assistant: I've conducted a risk assessment of your current portfolio:

Risk Metrics:
- Estimated Volatility: 12.5% annually
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.85 (moderate risk-adjusted return)
- Maximum Drawdown (historical): -18% (based on asset class performance)
- Beta to Ibovespa: 0.78 (less volatile than the market)

Stress Test Scenarios:
1. Market Correction (-15%):
   - Estimated Portfolio Impact: -9.3%
   - Most Affected: PETR4 (-22%), Ibovespa ETF (-15%)
   - Least Affected: Treasury Direct (-1%), Nu Reserva (-3%)

2. Economic Recession:
   - Estimated Portfolio Impact: -21%
   - Most Affected: PETR4 (-35%), Ibovespa ETF (-28%)
   - Least Affected: Treasury Direct (+2%), Nu Reserva (-5%)

3. Interest Rate Spike:
   - Estimated Portfolio Impact: -5%
   - Most Affected: Treasury Direct (-8%), Nu Reserva (-4%)
   - Least Affected: PETR4 (-2%), Ibovespa ETF (-3%)

Risk Concentration:
- 20% of your portfolio is in a single company (PETR4)
- 70% of your equity exposure is in Brazilian markets
- 50% of your portfolio is sensitive to interest rate changes

Would you like recommendations to reduce specific risks or improve your portfolio's resilience?

### Market Insights

- **Personalized Market Updates**: Relevant market news based on portfolio holdings
- **Economic Analysis**: Insights on economic trends affecting investments
- **Sector Performance**: Analysis of sector performance relevant to holdings
- **Investment Opportunities**: Identification of potential investment opportunities

Example interaction:
```
User: What's happening in the market that might affect my investments?
Assistant: Here are key market insights relevant to your portfolio:

Recent Developments:
1. Petrobras (PETR4): The company announced a new dividend policy, potentially increasing quarterly dividends by 15%. This could positively impact your PETR4 holdings.

2. Brazilian Equities (Ibovespa ETF): The Brazilian central bank held interest rates steady at 10.5%, contrary to market expectations of a rate cut. This may create short-term volatility in your Ibovespa ETF.

3. Fixed Income (Treasury Direct): Inflation data came in lower than expected at 4.2% annually, potentially setting up future interest rate cuts that could affect your Treasury Direct holdings.

Economic Outlook:
- GDP growth forecasts for Brazil have been revised upward to 2.8% for the year
- The Brazilian Real has strengthened against the USD by 3.5% over the past month
- Commodity prices, particularly oil, have increased by 7% in the last quarter

Potential Opportunities:
1. The infrastructure sector may benefit from newly announced government spending
2. Financial sector valuations are currently below historical averages
3. International diversification remains attractive as global markets show divergent performance
