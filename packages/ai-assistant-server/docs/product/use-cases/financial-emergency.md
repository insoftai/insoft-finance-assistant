# Financial Emergency Planning

## Overview

The Financial Emergency Planning feature helps users create and manage emergency funds and develop comprehensive financial contingency plans. This use case provides specialized functionality to calculate appropriate emergency fund sizes, suggest strategies for building emergency savings, identify potential financial risks, and recommend appropriate insurance coverage. The goal is to help users prepare for unexpected financial challenges and increase their financial resilience.

## Key Features

### Emergency Fund Calculator

- **Personalized Fund Size**: Calculate recommended emergency fund size based on individual circumstances
- **Expense Analysis**: Identify essential expenses that need coverage
- **Tiered Approach**: Suggest staged emergency fund goals (e.g., 1-month, 3-month, 6-month)
- **Location Adjustment**: Adjust recommendations based on local cost of living

Example interaction:
```
User: How much should I have in my emergency fund?
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you calculate an appropriate emergency fund size. To provide a personalized recommendation, I'll need some information about your financial situation:

1. What are your total monthly essential expenses? (housing, utilities, food, transportation, etc.)
2. How stable is your income? (very stable, somewhat stable, variable)
3. How many dependents do you have?
4. Do you have any specialized healthcare needs?

User: My essential expenses are about R$4,000 per month. My income is somewhat stable as I'm a government employee. I have 2 dependents and no special healthcare needs.
Assistant: Based on your information, here's my recommendation for your emergency fund:

Recommended Emergency Fund: R$24,000 (6 months of essential expenses)

This recommendation is based on:
- Monthly essential expenses: R$4,000
- Income stability: Somewhat stable (government employment provides good security, but policy changes can occur)
- Family size: You plus 2 dependents
- No specialized healthcare needs

I suggest building your emergency fund in tiers:
1. Tier 1 (Critical): R$8,000 (2 months) - Focus on reaching this level first
2. Tier 2 (Stable): R$16,000 (4 months) - Secondary goal
3. Tier 3 (Secure): R$24,000 (6 months) - Ultimate target

### Savings Strategies

- **Automated Savings Plans**: Recommend automatic transfer setups for emergency funds
- **Savings Acceleration**: Suggest ways to build emergency funds faster
- **Appropriate Vehicles**: Recommend suitable financial products for emergency funds
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and celebrate emergency fund milestones

Example interaction:
```
User: Yes, I'd like suggestions on how to build my emergency fund faster.
Assistant: Here are strategies to help you build your emergency fund more efficiently:

Automated Savings Approaches:
1. Set up an automatic transfer of R$500 per week to your emergency fund
2. Use a "round-up" savings app that rounds purchases to the nearest R$5 and saves the difference
3. Configure direct deposit to split your paycheck between checking and emergency savings

Acceleration Strategies:
1. Allocate 100% of any bonuses or tax refunds to your emergency fund until Tier 1 is reached
2. Consider a temporary "spending freeze" on non-essentials for 30 days
3. Review subscriptions and cancel unused services (potential savings: R$100-300/month)
4. Explore a side income opportunity for 3-6 months dedicated to emergency savings

Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund:
1. High-yield savings account (currently offering ~10% in Brazil)
2. Money market account with limited check-writing privileges
3. Short-term CDBs with no early withdrawal penalties

Avoid keeping emergency funds in:
- Long-term investments with penalties for early withdrawal
- Volatile investments like stocks or crypto
- Low-interest checking accounts

### Risk Assessment

User: What kinds of financial emergencies should I be prepared for?
Assistant: Based on your profile as a government employee with two dependents, here's a risk assessment of potential financial emergencies:

High Priority Risks:
1. Temporary Disability (Unable to work for 3+ months)
   - Probability: Moderate (5-10% lifetime risk)
   - Potential Impact: R$12,000-24,000 (3-6 months of expenses)
   - Current Preparedness: Low (No disability insurance mentioned)

2. Major Home Repair (e.g., roof damage, plumbing failure)
   - Probability: High (30-50% within 5 years)
   - Potential Impact: R$5,000-20,000
   - Current Preparedness: Unknown (Home insurance status not provided)

3. Family Medical Emergency
   - Probability: Moderate (15-25% within 5 years)
   - Potential Impact: R$3,000-15,000 (depending on insurance coverage)
   - Current Preparedness: Moderate (Assuming standard healthcare coverage)

Medium Priority Risks:
1. Job Restructuring/Relocation
   - Probability: Low-Moderate for government employees (3-7% annually)
   - Potential Impact: R$8,000-16,000 (relocation costs, temporary income gap)
   - Current Preparedness: Low (Emergency fund not yet established)

2. Vehicle Replacement/Major Repair
   - Probability: Moderate (20-30% within 3 years)
   - Potential Impact: R$3,000-30,000
   - Current Preparedness: Unknown (Vehicle insurance status not provided)

     * This would replace 5-8 years of income for your dependents
   - Estimated Cost: R$100-200/month (based on age and health)
   - Potential Benefit: Financial security for dependents if income is lost

3. Disability Insurance
   - Current: Likely basic coverage through employer
   - Recommendation: Supplemental long-term disability insurance covering 60-70% of income
   - Estimated Cost: R$150-300/month
