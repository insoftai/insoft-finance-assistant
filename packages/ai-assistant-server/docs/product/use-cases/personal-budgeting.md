## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Budget Categories

Start by setting up budget categories that match your spending patterns:

```
You: I want to create a budget

Tamy: Great! I'd be happy to help you create a budget. Let's start with
      your main spending categories. Common categories include:

      - Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities)
      - Food (groceries, dining out)
      - Transportation (gas, public transit, car maintenance)
      - Entertainment (streaming services, hobbies, outings)
      - Shopping (clothing, household items)
      - Personal care (haircuts, gym, etc.)

      Which category would you like to budget for first?

You: Let's start with groceries

Tamy: Good choice! How much would you like to budget for groceries,
      and for what time period (weekly, monthly)?

You: $500 per month

Tamy: I've created a monthly grocery budget of $500. Would you like
      to set up another budget category?
```

Continue this process for each of your main spending categories.

### 2. Record Your Expenses

As you spend money, tell Tamy about your expenses:

```
You: I spent $85 at Kroger today

Tamy: I've recorded your $85 expense at Kroger in the Groceries
      category for today. Your total grocery spending this month
      is now $85, which is 17% of your $500 monthly grocery budget.
```

You can also send photos of receipts:

```
You: [Sends photo of grocery receipt]

Tamy: Thanks for the receipt! I've recorded your $112.45 expense
      at Whole Foods in the Groceries category for today. Your
      total grocery spending this month is now $197.45, which is
      39% of your $500 monthly grocery budget.
```

### 3. Check Your Budget Status

Regularly check your budget status to stay on track:

```
You: How am I doing with my budgets?

Tamy: Here's an overview of your budget performance this month:

      Groceries: $197.45/$500 (39%) - On track
      Dining Out: $120/$200 (60%) - On track
      Transportation: $180/$300 (60%) - On track
      Entertainment: $45/$100 (45%) - On track

      You're doing well with all your budgets so far this month.
      You're about halfway through the month and your spending is
      proportional to the time elapsed.
```

### 4. Get Budget Insights

Ask Tamy for insights about your budget performance:

```
You: What insights do you have about my grocery spending?

Tamy: Here are some insights about your grocery spending:

      1. Your grocery spending is consistent week to week,
         averaging about $100 per week.

      2. You tend to spend more on groceries at the beginning
         of the month than at the end.

      3. Your most frequent grocery stores are Whole Foods (40%
         of spending) and Kroger (35% of spending).

      4. You spend about 20% of your grocery budget on organic
         produce, which aligns with your stated health priorities.

      Would you like some recommendations for optimizing your
      grocery budget?
```

### 5. Adjust Your Budgets as Needed

As your financial situation changes, adjust your budgets:

```
You: I need to reduce my grocery budget to $450

Tamy: I've updated your monthly grocery budget from $500 to $450.
      You've spent $197.45 so far this month, which is 44% of your
      new budget. You have $252.55 remaining for the rest of the month.

      Would you like some tips for staying within your reduced
