   - Stock sales under R$20,000 per month are exempt from capital gains tax
   - Long-term holdings reduce effective tax rate
   - Recommendation: Consider monthly stock purchases under the exemption threshold

4. Real Estate Fund (FII) Strategy
   - Dividends from FIIs are tax-exempt for individuals
   - Capital gains are taxed at 20%
   - Recommendation: Focus on dividend-yielding FIIs for regular tax-free income

5. International Diversification Considerations
   - Foreign investments are subject to different tax rules
   - Consider Brazilian ETFs that track international markets for simpler tax treatment
