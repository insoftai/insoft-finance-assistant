# Retirement Planning

## Overview

The Retirement Planning feature helps users prepare for their financial future by creating, monitoring, and optimizing retirement savings strategies. This use case provides specialized functionality to calculate retirement needs, recommend appropriate savings rates and investment allocations, track progress toward retirement goals, and simulate different retirement scenarios. The goal is to help users build financial security for their retirement years through personalized planning and actionable guidance.

## Key Features

### Retirement Needs Calculator

- **Lifestyle-Based Projections**: Estimate retirement needs based on desired lifestyle
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Account for inflation in long-term projections
- **Longevity Analysis**: Plan for appropriate life expectancy
- **Replacement Rate Calculation**: Determine percentage of pre-retirement income needed

Example interaction:
```
User: I'm 35 years old and want to retire at 65. How much should I be saving for retirement?
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you plan for retirement. Let me ask a few questions to provide a personalized calculation:

1. What's your current annual income?
User: R$120,000

2. What percentage of your current income do you think you'll need in retirement?
User: Maybe 80%?

3. Do you have any existing retirement savings?
User: Yes, about R$150,000 in my retirement accounts

Based on your information, here's your retirement projection:

Current age: 35
Target retirement age: 65
Years until retirement: 30
Years in retirement (based on average life expectancy): 25
Current annual income: R$120,000
Desired retirement income: R$96,000/year (80% of current income)
Current retirement savings: R$150,000

Accounting for an average inflation rate of 4% and expected investment returns of 7%:

Estimated retirement needs:
- Total needed at retirement: R$4,800,000
- Current savings future value: R$1,140,000
- Additional savings needed: R$3,660,000

Recommended monthly contribution: R$3,050

This would put you on track to maintain your desired lifestyle in retirement. Would you like to explore different scenarios or investment strategies?

### Savings Strategy Recommendations

- **Contribution Rate Guidance**: Recommend optimal savings percentages
- **Account Type Optimization**: Suggest appropriate retirement account types
- **Catch-Up Strategies**: Provide options for those behind on retirement savings
- **Tax-Efficient Planning**: Maximize tax advantages in retirement planning

Example interaction:
```
User: Yes, please recommend the best way to save for retirement in my situation.
Assistant: Based on your financial profile, here's my recommended retirement savings strategy:

Recommended Account Allocation:
1. Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan (if available):
   - Contribute at least up to any employer match (typically 3-6%)
   - This is essentially "free money" and provides immediate 100% return

2. Private Pension Plan (Previdência Privada):
   - PGBL (Plano Gerador de Benefício Livre):
     - Recommended for tax deduction benefits
     - Contributions can be deducted from income tax (up to 12% of gross income)
     - Ideal if you file complete tax returns
     - Monthly contribution: R$1,200 (12% of your monthly income)

   - VGBL (Vida Gerador de Benefício Livre):
     - Recommended for additional contributions beyond PGBL limits
     - More flexible for withdrawals
     - Monthly contribution: R$850

3. Additional Investments:
   - Tax-efficient ETFs and index funds: R$1,000/month
   - These provide growth potential with lower fees

Total Monthly Retirement Savings: R$3,050

Tax Optimization Strategy:
- Maximize PGBL contributions to reduce current tax burden
- Diversify between PGBL and VGBL to balance tax benefits now vs. later
- Consider Tesouro Direto (government bonds) for stable, tax-advantaged growth

Would you like me to explain any of these recommendations in more detail?

### Retirement Portfolio Management

- **Age-Based Asset Allocation**: Recommend appropriate investment mix based on age
- **Risk Tolerance Assessment**: Adjust strategies based on personal risk tolerance
- **Rebalancing Reminders**: Suggest when to rebalance retirement portfolios
- **Diversification Analysis**: Ensure proper diversification across retirement accounts

Example interaction:
```
User: What investment mix should I have in my retirement accounts?
Assistant: Based on your age (35) and target retirement age (65), here's my recommended investment allocation for your retirement portfolio:

Recommended Asset Allocation:
- Stocks/Equities: 70%
  - Brazilian Stocks (Ibovespa funds): 35%
  - International Stocks (Global ETFs): 35%
- Fixed Income: 25%
  - Government Bonds (Tesouro Direto): 15%
  - Corporate Bonds (CDBs, LCIs, LCAs): 10%
- Alternative Investments: 5%
  - Real Estate Funds (FIIs): 5%

This allocation balances growth potential with reasonable risk for someone with 30 years until retirement. The higher allocation to equities provides growth potential, while the fixed income portion offers stability.

Risk Assessment:
Based on historical data, this portfolio has:
- Expected average annual return: 7-9%
- Volatility (risk level): Moderate
- Worst historical 1-year performance: -15% to -20%
- Best historical 1-year performance: +25% to +30%

As you approach retirement, we should gradually shift this allocation to become more conservative:
- At age 45: Reduce equities to 60%
- At age 55: Reduce equities to 50%
- At age 60: Reduce equities to 40%
- At retirement (65): 30% equities, 60% fixed income, 10% alternatives

Would you like me to recommend specific funds or investment vehicles for each category?

### Retirement Scenario Simulation

- **Retirement Age Variations**: Compare outcomes of retiring at different ages
- **Savings Rate Scenarios**: Show impact of different contribution levels
- **Market Performance Simulations**: Model retirement outcomes under various market conditions
- **Withdrawal Strategy Analysis**: Optimize retirement fund withdrawal strategies

Example interaction:
```
User: What if I want to retire earlier, at 55 instead of 65?
Assistant: I've run a simulation for early retirement at age 55 compared to your original plan of retiring at 65. Here are the results:

Early Retirement Scenario (Age 55):
- Years until retirement: 20 (instead of 30)
- Years in retirement: 35 (instead of 25)
- Total needed at retirement: R$6,720,000
  (Higher than original R$4,800,000 due to longer retirement period and fewer years to save)
- Current savings future value at 55: R$580,000
- Additional savings needed: R$6,140,000
- Required monthly contribution: R$12,100
  (Compared to R$3,050 for retirement at 65)

Impact Analysis:
1. Monthly Savings Requirement: 297% increase
2. Lifestyle Impact: Saving R$12,100 monthly would require allocating 121% of your current discretionary income to retirement
3. Investment Risk: May require more aggressive investment strategy to reach goals

Alternative Scenarios:
1. Partial Early Retirement at 55:
   - Work part-time from 55-65 earning 50% of full salary
   - Required monthly contribution now: R$6,200

2. Hybrid Approach:
   - Increase monthly contributions to R$5,000 now
   - Delay retirement to age 60 (instead of 55)
   - Required lifestyle adjustment: Moderate

3. Accelerated Savings Timeline:
   - Aggressive saving for next 10 years (R$8,000/month)
   - Then standard contributions (R$3,000/month) for final 10 years
   - Retirement possible at 57-58

Would you like me to explore any of these alternative scenarios in more detail?
