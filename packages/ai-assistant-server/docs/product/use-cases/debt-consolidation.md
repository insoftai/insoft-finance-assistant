# Debt Consolidation Planning

## Overview

The Debt Consolidation Planning feature helps users plan and manage debt consolidation strategies. This use case provides specialized functionality to analyze existing debts, recommend consolidation options, simulate different repayment strategies, and calculate potential savings. The goal is to help users reduce interest costs, simplify payments, and accelerate debt payoff.

## Key Features

### Debt Overview

- **Comprehensive Debt Tracking**: Aggregate all debts in one place (credit cards, loans, financing)
- **Interest Rate Analysis**: Highlight high-interest debts that are prime for consolidation
- **Payment Schedule Visualization**: Show current payment schedules and due dates
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Calculate and track debt-to-income ratio over time

Example interaction:
```
User: I need help managing my debts. I have several credit cards and a personal loan.
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you manage your debts. Let's start by getting a complete picture of what you owe.

Could you provide details about your debts, including:
1. Type of debt (credit card, loan, etc.)
2. Current balance
3. Interest rate
4. Minimum monthly payment

User: I have a Nubank credit card with R$5,000 at 12% monthly, an Itaú card with R$8,000 at 14% monthly, and a personal loan of R$15,000 at 3.5% monthly with a R$850 payment.
Assistant: Thanks for sharing those details. Here's an overview of your current debt situation:

Total debt: R$28,000

Breakdown:
1. Nubank Credit Card
   - Balance: R$5,000
   - Interest rate: 12% monthly (290% APY)
   - Minimum payment: ~R$250/month

2. Itaú Credit Card
   - Balance: R$8,000
   - Interest rate: 14% monthly (350% APY)
   - Minimum payment: ~R$400/month

3. Personal Loan
   - Balance: R$15,000
   - Interest rate: 3.5% monthly (51% APY)
   - Monthly payment: R$850

Your current debt-to-income ratio is approximately 37.5% (assuming a monthly income of R$4,000).

### Consolidation Strategies

- **Option Comparison**: Compare different consolidation methods (personal loans, balance transfers, etc.)
- **Eligibility Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood of qualifying for various consolidation options
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Calculate total costs and savings for each option
- **Risk Assessment**: Highlight potential risks and downsides of each strategy

Example interaction:
```
User: Yes, I'd like to see what consolidation options I have.
Assistant: Based on your debt profile, here are three consolidation strategies to consider:

1. Personal Loan Consolidation
   - Consolidate all debts into a new personal loan
   - Estimated interest rate: 2.5% monthly (34% APY)
   - Monthly payment: R$1,050
   - Total interest paid: R$7,200
   - Potential savings: R$18,500 compared to current debts
   - Payoff time: 36 months
   - Pros: Lower interest rate, single payment, fixed payoff date
   - Cons: Requires good credit score, may have origination fees

2. Balance Transfer to Lower-Rate Credit Card
   - Transfer credit card balances to a new card with promotional rate
   - Estimated interest rate: 0% for 12 months, then 4% monthly
   - Monthly payment: R$1,100
   - Total interest paid: R$4,800
   - Potential savings: R$20,900 compared to current debts
   - Payoff time: 30 months
   - Pros: Zero interest during promotional period
   - Cons: Requires excellent credit, transfer fees, rate increases after promo period

3. Debt Snowball Method (No Consolidation)
   - Pay minimum on all debts except smallest, which gets extra payments
   - Monthly payment: Same as current (R$1,500)
   - Total interest paid: R$15,300
   - Potential savings: R$10,400 compared to current approach
   - Payoff time: 42 months
   - Pros: No new credit needed, psychological wins as debts are paid off
   - Cons: Higher interest cost than other options, longer payoff time

### Repayment Simulations

- **Interactive Calculators**: Adjust payment amounts and see impact on payoff timeline
- **What-If Scenarios**: Simulate adding extra payments or windfalls
- **Stress Testing**: Model the impact of financial emergencies or income changes
- **Milestone Tracking**: Set and track debt reduction milestones

Example interaction:
```
User: I'm interested in the personal loan option. Can we see how different payment amounts would affect the timeline?
Assistant: Absolutely! Let's simulate different payment scenarios for the personal loan consolidation option:

Base scenario: R$28,000 loan at 2.5% monthly interest
- R$1,050/month: 36 months to payoff, R$7,200 in interest

Alternative scenarios:
1. R$1,200/month: 29 months to payoff, R$5,800 in interest (R$1,400 savings)
2. R$1,500/month: 22 months to payoff, R$4,300 in interest (R$2,900 savings)
3. R$2,000/month: 16 months to payoff, R$3,000 in interest (R$4,200 savings)

If you received a R$5,000 bonus and applied it to the loan:
- With R$1,050/month: 30 months to payoff (6 months saved), R$5,900 in interest
- With R$1,500/month: 18 months to payoff (4 months saved), R$3,400 in interest

What payment amount seems most feasible for your budget?

### Interest Savings Calculator

- **Total Interest Comparison**: Compare interest costs between current and consolidated debts
- **Amortization Schedules**: Show detailed payment breakdowns over time
- **Opportunity Cost Analysis**: Calculate what saved interest could be worth if invested
- **Early Payoff Incentives**: Highlight benefits of making extra payments

Example interaction:
```
User: I think I could manage R$1,500 per month. How much would I save compared to my current situation?
Assistant: Great choice! Here's how the R$1,500 monthly payment on a consolidation loan compares to your current debt situation:

Current Debt Approach:
- Monthly payment: ~R$1,500 (combined minimums)
- Payoff time: 60+ months
- Total interest paid: ~R$25,700

Consolidation Loan with R$1,500/month:
- Monthly payment: R$1,500
- Payoff time: 22 months
- Total interest paid: R$4,300

Your total savings would be approximately R$21,400 in interest!

Additionally, you'd be debt-free 38+ months sooner.

If you invested the R$1,500 monthly payment for 3 years after becoming debt-free, assuming a 8% annual return, you could accumulate approximately R$63,000 in savings.

Would you like me to help you explore lenders offering consolidation loans with these terms?
