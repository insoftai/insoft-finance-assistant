## How to Use Financial Goal Setting

### Creating a Goal

To create a new financial goal, tell Tamy what you're saving for:

```
You: I want to save for a vacation to Europe

Tamy: That's a great goal! To help you set up your vacation fund,
      I need a few details:

      1. How much do you want to save for your Europe vacation?
      2. When do you want to reach this goal?

You: I want to save $3,000 by next June

Tamy: I've created your "Europe Vacation" goal of $3,000 with a
      deadline of June 30, 2024. That's 12 months from now, so
      you'll need to save about $250 per month to reach your goal.

      Would you like me to suggest a savings plan for this goal?
```

### Checking Goal Progress

To check your progress toward a goal, ask Tamy:

```
You: How am I doing with my vacation fund?

Tamy: Your "Europe Vacation" goal is 25% complete. You've saved
      $750 of your $3,000 target. You have 9 months left to save
      the remaining $2,250, which means you need to save about
      $250 per month to reach your goal on time.

      You're currently on track with your goal!
```

### Recording a Contribution

To record a contribution to your goal, tell Tamy:

```
You: I want to add $200 to my vacation fund

Tamy: I've recorded your $200 contribution to your "Europe Vacation"
      goal. Your current balance is now $950, which is 32% of your
      $3,000 target. You have 9 months left to save the remaining
      $2,050, which means you need to save about $228 per month to
      reach your goal on time.

      Great job on making progress toward your goal!
```

### Getting Goal Recommendations

Tamy can provide recommendations to help you achieve your goals faster:

```
You: How can I reach my vacation goal faster?

Tamy: Here are some recommendations to help you reach your
      "Europe Vacation" goal faster:

      1. Increase your monthly contribution from $250 to $300.
         This would help you reach your goal 2 months earlier.

      2. Based on your spending patterns, you could reduce your
         dining out budget by $50 per month and redirect those
         funds to your vacation goal.

      3. Consider setting up automatic transfers to your vacation
         fund right after you receive your paycheck.

      4. Look for one-time opportunities to boost your savings,
         such as selling unused items or taking on a short-term
         side project.

      Would you like me to help you implement any of these recommendations?
```

### Adjusting a Goal

If you need to adjust your goal, simply tell Tamy:

```
You: I need to change my vacation goal to $3,500

Tamy: I've updated your "Europe Vacation" goal from $3,000 to $3,500.
      You've currently saved $950, which is 27% of your new target.
      You have 9 months left to save the remaining $2,550, which
      means you need to save about $283 per month to reach your
      goal on time.

      Would you like me to update your savings plan for this goal?
