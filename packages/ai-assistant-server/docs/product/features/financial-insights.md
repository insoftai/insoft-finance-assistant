### Getting General Insights

To get general insights about your finances, ask Tamy:

```
You: What insights do you have about my finances?

Tamy: Based on your financial data, here are some insights:

      1. Your overall spending is 5% lower this month compared
         to last month, which is a positive trend.

      2. You've been consistently staying within your grocery
         budget, but your dining out expenses have exceeded
         your budget for 3 consecutive months.

      3. Your emergency fund is growing steadily and is now at
         65% of your target.

      4. Your highest spending category this month is Housing (35%),
         followed by Transportation (15%) and Groceries (12%).

      Would you like more specific insights about any of these areas?

### Getting Category-Specific Insights

You can ask for insights about specific spending categories:

```
You: Give me insights about my dining out expenses

Tamy: Here are insights about your dining out expenses:

      1. You spent $320 on dining out this month, which is
         $120 (60%) over your monthly budget of $200.

      2. Your dining out expenses have increased by 25%
         compared to last month.

      3. Most of your dining out expenses occur on weekends,
         with Saturday being your highest spending day.

      4. Your most frequent dining locations are Starbucks (8 visits),
         Chipotle (5 visits), and Olive Garden (2 visits).

      5. Coffee shops account for 30% of your dining out expenses.

      Would you like some recommendations for reducing your
      dining out expenses?

### Getting Savings Recommendations

Tamy can provide recommendations for saving money:

```
You: How can I save more money?

Tamy: Based on your financial data, here are some savings recommendations:

      1. Your subscription services total $85 per month. Consider
         reviewing these services and canceling any you don't use regularly.

      2. You're spending an average of $15 per workday on lunch.
         Bringing lunch from home even 2-3 days per week could
         save you $120-$180 per month.

      3. Your utility bills are higher than average. Simple energy-saving
         measures could reduce these costs by 10-15%.

      4. You frequently make small purchases (under $10) that add up
         to $150 per month. Being more mindful of these small expenses
         could yield significant savings.

      Would you like me to help you implement any of these recommendations?

### Getting Budget Insights

Tamy can provide insights about your budget performance:

```
You: How am I doing with my budgets?

Tamy: Here's an overview of your budget performance this month:

      ✅ Groceries: $350/$400 (88%) - On track
      ❌ Dining Out: $320/$200 (160%) - Over budget
      ✅ Transportation: $280/$300 (93%) - On track
      ✅ Entertainment: $85/$100 (85%) - On track
      ✅ Shopping: $120/$150 (80%) - On track
      ❌ Utilities: $220/$200 (110%) - Slightly over budget

      Overall, you're doing well with most of your budgets.
      The main area of concern is dining out, where you're
      significantly over budget. Would you like some tips for
      reducing your dining out expenses?

### Getting Goal Insights

Tamy can provide insights about your financial goals:

```
You: How am I progressing with my financial goals?

Tamy: Here's an overview of your financial goals:

      Emergency Fund: $4,500/$6,000 (75%) - On track
      Europe Vacation: $950/$3,000 (32%) - Slightly behind
      Down Payment: $8,200/$20,000 (41%) - On track

      Your emergency fund and down payment goals are progressing
      well. However, your vacation fund is slightly behind schedule.
      To get back on track, you would need to increase your monthly
      contributions from $250 to $285.

      Would you like me to adjust your savings plan for your vacation goal?
