## How to Use Budget Management

### Creating a Budget

To create a new budget, simply tell Tamy what category you want to budget for and how much you want to allocate:

```
You: I want to create a budget for dining out

Tamy: I'd be happy to help you create a dining out budget.
      How much would you like to allocate for dining out,
      and for what time period (weekly, monthly)?

You: $200 per month

Tamy: Great! I've created a monthly dining out budget of $200.
      I'll track your dining expenses against this budget and
      let you know how you're doing.
```

### Checking Your Budget

To check your current budget status, ask Tamy about your budget:

```
You: How am I doing with my dining out budget?

Tamy: You've spent $120 of your $200 monthly dining out budget (60%).
      You have $80 remaining for the rest of the month (15 days left).
      You're on track with your budget so far!
```

### Adjusting Your Budget

If you need to adjust your budget, simply tell Tamy:

```
You: I need to increase my grocery budget to $500

Tamy: I've updated your monthly grocery budget from $400 to $500.
      You've spent $250 so far this month, so you have $250
      remaining for the next 18 days.
```

### Getting Budget Recommendations

Tamy can analyze your spending patterns and provide budget recommendations:

```
You: Can you recommend budget improvements?

Tamy: Based on your spending patterns, here are some recommendations:

      1. Your entertainment spending is consistently 20% over budget.
         Consider increasing your entertainment budget from $100 to $120.

      2. You're only using 60% of your transportation budget.
         You could reduce it from $300 to $200 and reallocate those
         funds to your savings goal.

      3. Your grocery spending varies significantly week to week.
         Consider using a weekly budget instead of a monthly budget
         for better tracking.

      Would you like me to make any of these changes for you?
