## Step 3: Set Up Your Account

To get the most out of Tamy, you'll need to set up your account:

```
You: I'd like to set up my account

Tamy: Great! I'll help you set up your account. I just need a few details:

1. What's your name?

You: Jane Smith

Tamy: Nice to meet you, Jane! Now, let's set up your basic financial profile:

2. What's your primary financial goal right now? (e.g., saving for a goal, reducing debt, budgeting better)

You: I want to budget better

Tamy: Excellent! Budgeting is a great place to start. Last question:

3. How would you describe your current financial knowledge? (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

You: Beginner

Tamy: Thanks, Jane! I've created your account. I'll tailor my assistance to focus on budgeting and provide explanations suitable for beginners.

Would you like to start by creating your first budget category?
```

## Step 4: Create Your First Budget

Setting up your first budget is a great way to start:

```
You: Yes, let's create a budget

Tamy: Let's create your first budget category. What would you like to budget for? Common categories include:
- Groceries
- Dining out
- Entertainment
- Transportation
- Housing
- Utilities

You: Groceries

Tamy: Great choice! How much would you like to budget for groceries, and for what time period (weekly, monthly)?

You: $400 per month

Tamy: I've created a monthly grocery budget of $400. I'll track your grocery expenses against this budget and let you know how you're doing.

Would you like to set up another budget category?
```

## Step 5: Record Your First Transaction

Start tracking your expenses by recording a transaction:

```
You: I spent $45 at the grocery store today

Tamy: I've recorded your $45 expense in the Groceries category for today. Your total grocery spending this month is now $45, which is 11% of your $400 monthly grocery budget.

Is there anything else you'd like to record or ask about?
```

## Step 6: Explore Tamy's Features

Now that you've set up your account, created your first budget, and recorded your first transaction, you can explore Tamy's other features:

### Set a Financial Goal

```
You: I want to save for a vacation

Tamy: That's a great goal! To help you set up your vacation fund, I need a few details:

1. How much do you want to save for your vacation?
2. When do you want to reach this goal?

You: $2,000 by next summer

Tamy: I've created your "Vacation" goal of $2,000 with a deadline of June 30, 2024. That's 12 months from now, so you'll need to save about $167 per month to reach your goal.

Would you like me to suggest a savings plan for this goal?
```

### Get Financial Insights

```
You: What insights do you have about my finances?

Tamy: Based on your financial data so far:

1. You've recorded 5 transactions totaling $210 this month.
2. Your largest spending category is Groceries ($120).
3. You're currently on track with your grocery budget.
4. Your vacation savings goal is 5% complete.

As you record more transactions, I'll be able to provide more detailed insights and recommendations.
```

### Learn About Financial Concepts

```
You: What's an emergency fund?

Tamy: An emergency fund is a savings account set aside specifically for unexpected expenses or financial emergencies, such as medical bills, car repairs, or job loss.

Financial experts typically recommend having 3-6 months of essential expenses saved in your emergency fund. This provides a financial safety net that can help you avoid debt when unexpected costs arise.

For example, if your essential monthly expenses (housing, utilities, food, transportation) total $2,000, you should aim for an emergency fund of $6,000-$12,000.

Would you like me to help you set up an emergency fund goal?
